# PERSUADE  
**ParamEtRic SUrvivAl moDel sElection**

A standardized R template designed to support the selection of parametric survival models and their implementation in decision-analytic models.

---

## Overview

PERSUADE is crafted to guide analysts through a robust, reproducible workflow for selecting the most appropriate **parametric survival model** for time-to-event data. It offers:

- Visual tools for exploring time-to-event data  
- Diagnostics for proportional hazards and hazard patterns over time  
- Goodness-of-fit evaluation via visual and statistical methods  
- Model extrapolation insights; essential for long-term projections  

This template streamlines complex survival analysis within decision modeling frameworks.

## Features & Workflow

The framework supports the analyst in:

1. **Visualizing** raw time-to-event data  
2. **Assessing** the proportional hazards assumption  
3. **Examining** hazard rates over time  
4. **Comparing** parametric survival model fits:
   - Visualization of survival curves and transition probabilities  
   - Model diagnostics  
5. **Quantifying** fit with statistical metrics  
6. **Exploring** model extrapolation beyond observed data

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- R (version compatible with survival and other dependencies)
- Recommended: RStudio for better environment handling

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Load PERSUADE package:**  
   devtools::install_github("Bram-R/PERSUADE")

2. **Specify input see `PERSUADE_input.R` as example (https://github.com/Bram-R/PERSUADE/blob/master/PERSUADE_input.R):**  
   - Specify your input dataset (e.g., CSV or R object)  
   - Set the project name and outcome identifier using the `name` parameter  

3. **Customize Analysis Options:**  
   Within the call to `f_PERSUADE(...)`, toggle options (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) for the analyses you want to run  

4. **Run the Workflow:**  
   - Use print(), summary() and plot() on the PERSUADE (S3) object
   - Execute f_generate_report() using the PERSUADE object as input to generate an R Markdown report. Figures will be saved into a subdirectory named after the `name` parameter.

## Outputs & Interpretation

Upon execution, expect:

- A structured output directory tied to your project name  
- Visualizations: Kaplanâ€“Meier curves, hazard plots, model-fit overlays  
- Diagnostic outputs: diagnostic plots, goodness-of-fit comparisons  
- An R Markdown report ready for rendering R Markdown reports detailing your analysis  

These outputs help critically evaluate model fit, especially for extrapolating survival beyond the observed timeline.

## Extending or Customizing

- **Add new model types:** Incorporate additional parametric distributions or non-parametric methods by extending `f_PERSUADE()`.  
- **Refine plots:** Customize visualizations in `PERSUADE_output_functions.R` or adopt themes for publication-quality graphics.  
- **Scale to new data formats:** Build data preprocessing modules for commonly used formats (e.g., survival objects, breakpoints, long-format datasets).  
- **Automate Reporting:** Enhance the R Markdown template for production-ready reports with headers, metadata, or version control.
