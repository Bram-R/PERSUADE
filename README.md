# PERSUADE

The ParamEtRic SUrvivAl moDel sElection (PERSUADE) template is a standardised survival analysis template to support the selection of parametric survival models and their implementation in decision analytic models. 

Specifically, The intention of the template was to provide information and support the decisions concerning parametric survival model selection:
1)	Visualisation of time-to-event data
2)	Examine the proportional hazard assumption
3)	Examine the hazard over time
4)	Visually examine the goodness of fit by a. visualisation of parametric survival models and b. examine diagnostics of parametric survival models
5)	Examine statistical goodness of fit
6)	Examine extrapolation
