Description: Provides a standardized framework to support the selection
    and evaluation of parametric survival models for time-to-event data.
    Includes tools for visualizing survival data, checking proportional
    hazards assumptions, comparing parametric and cure models, examining
    hazard functions, and evaluating model extrapolation. Results are
    structured to facilitate integration into decision-analytic models,
    and reports can be generated with R Markdown for reproducible
    workflows.
